mongoose agrregation quries are allowed by the package mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2
we have installed this package into our project and used it into the video.model.js file, I t is injected as a plugin into the code Schema


there is a difference between bcrypt and bcryptJs. bcryptJs is used most commonly
but here we will use core bcrypt in our project. It helps you to hash your password

JsonWebToken is used to generate tokens. both jwt and bcrypt work based on cryptography
Direct Encryption is not posiible hence we take help of some hooks given by mongoose, for example : pre (pre hook is a middleware which runs just before the data is getting saved)  (we have used this pre hook inside user.model.js to encrypt the password just before data gets saved)

while using pre hooks for encyption, dont use arrow function as the arrow function has no context reference hence we cant use this keyword inside the arrow functions

JWT is a bearer token like a key to database
